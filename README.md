## Software Engineering 2 - Configuration Management Assignment
<!-- Joshua Ludolf -->

SCM, or Software Configuration Management, is a process for systematically managing changes to software. It involves tracking and controlling changes in the software, ensuring that all changes are recorded, and managing the integration of different versions and components of the software. GitHub helps with SCM by providing a platform for version control, collaboration, and code review. It allows developers to:

<i>
- Track changes to their code with Git, a distributed version control system. <br>
</i>

<i>
- Collaborate with others through pull requests, branches, and forks. <br>
</i>

<i>
- Review and discuss code changes using inline comments and discussions. <br>
</i>

<i>
- Automate workflows with GitHub Actions. <br>
</i>

<i>
- Maintain a history of all changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed. <br>
</i>
